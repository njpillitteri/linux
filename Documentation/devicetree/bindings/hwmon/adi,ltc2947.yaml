properties:

    enum:
      - adi,ltc2947

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  clocks:
    description:
      The LTC2947 uses either a trimmed internal oscillator or an external clock as the time
      base for determining the integration period to represent time, charge and energy. When
      an external clock is used, this property must be set accordingly.
    maxItems: 1

  adi,accumulator-ctl-pol:
    description:
      This property controls the polarity of current that is accumulatred to calculate charge and
      energy so that, they can be only accumulated for positive current for example. Since there are
      two sets of registers for the accumulated values, this entry can also have two items which sets
      energy1/charge1 and energy2/charger2 respectively. Check table 12 of the datasheet for more
      information on the supported options.

    default: {0 0}

  adi,accumulation-deadband-microamp:
    description:
      This property controls the Accumulation Dead band which allows to set the level of current below which
      no accumulation takes place.
