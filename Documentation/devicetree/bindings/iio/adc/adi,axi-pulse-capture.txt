 Analog Device AXI Pulse and Laser driver controller

Required properties:
 - compatible: Must be "adi,axi-pulse-capture-1.00.a".
 - reg: Specification for the controllers memory mapped register map.
 - interrupts: Specification for the controllers interrupt.
 - clocks: Phandle and specifier to the controllers AXI interface clock.

Example:

axi_pulse_capture: axi-pulse-capture@7c700000 {
	compatible = "adi,axi-pulse-capture-1.00.a";
	reg = <0x7c700000 0x10000>;
	interrupts = <0 52 0>;
	clocks = <&clkc 17>;
};
