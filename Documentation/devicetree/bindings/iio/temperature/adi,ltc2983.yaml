  adi,mux-delay-config:
    description:
      The LTC2983 performs 2 or 3 internal conversion cycles per temperature result.
      Each conversion cycle is performed with different excitation and input multiplexer
      configurations. Prior to each conversion, these excitation circuits and input
      switch configurations are changed and an internal 1ms delay ensures settling prior
      to the conversion cycle in most cases. An extra delay can be configured using this
      property. The value written here is multiplied by 100us.
